# Domain Hunter HQ

Choosing the right business name is challenging, and finding the right fit can be tough, especially when many desirable names are already taken. Our project utilizes WhoisXML API's tools to access global domain registration data, allowing users to quickly check if their desired business name is available. If the name is already taken, we'll provide you with information on the current owner. It's the ultimate tool for securing the perfect name for your business endeavor.

## User Story

```
AS A business owner
I WANT to see if a domain name is available
SO THAT I can register for it
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a domain checker with form inputs

1. WHEN I enter a domain name to search
THEN I am presented whether the domain name is available or taken.

2. WHEN a domain is taken
THEN I am presented with how old the domain is and its registered owner's contact info.
```
